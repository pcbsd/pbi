<a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

Welcome to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory - the latest game set in the Wolfenstein universe. Players battle in teams as Axis or Allies wage war in a series of linked maps in a brand new campaign mode 
or over traditional single maps.<br><br> 

Enemy Territory is a Team Game. It rewards co-operation, teamwork and tactics. Enemy Territory is complex. We strongly recommend that you read through this entire manual, as the information contained herein will greatly increase your playing enjoyment and understanding of the battleground.<br><br>

<a name="B_QuickStart" id="B_QuickStart"></a><h2>B.	Quick Start</h2>

<br>

<b>B.1	Create a Profile</b><br>
The first time you run Enemy Territory, you'll be prompted to enter the name of a profile. This profile will store your key configuration, player name, and more. Enter the profile name you wish to be known by online, choose your graphics and mouse options, whether you are Left or Right-handed and set your connection speed. Playing with incorrect connection settings can significantly degrade game performance. When you're happy with your choices, click "Create" to proceed.<br><br>

<b>B.2	Find a Server</b><br>
To find a server to play on, click "Play Online" in the main menu. This will bring up the server list. Make sure that "Internet" is selected in the "Filters" section (click "Source" to change it). Click on a server to choose it, enable PunkBuster and then click "Join Server" in the lower right of the browser.<br><br>

<b>B.3	Review the Objectives</b><br>
After you've connected to the game, you'll be taken to the Limbo Menu, where you can see the objectives, choose a class and more. On the bottom of the screen you'll see the map objectives. These are what each team has to accomplish to win the game. Clicking the Axis or Allies tab will show you the objectives for that team and you can scroll through them with the arrows to review them. Hit the Play Briefing button to hear an audio introduction to the map.<br><br>

<b>B.4	Choose a Team and Class</b><br>
On the top right-hand side of the screen in the Limbo Menu, choose a team (Axis, Allies or Spectator) by clicking the appropriate flag. Then choose a class by clicking one of the class buttons beneath the flag selection (the numbers under each button tell you how many team members there currently are in that class). <br><br>

<a href="#K1_Soldier">Soldiers</a> have the greatest choice of weapons including Heavy Weapons. <a href="#K2_Medic">Medics</a> can heal living players with Health Packs and bring fallen players back into play by reviving them with Syringes.
<a href="#K3_Engineer">Engineers</a> can construct objectives and also plant explosives like Dynamite and Land Mines.
<a href="#K4_FieldOps">Field Ops</a> resupply their team-mates with ammunition and can call in heavy fire support in the form of Air 
Strikes and Artillery Strikes. <a href="#K5_CovertOps">Covert Ops</a> scout out the battlefield, and can steal the uniform of dead enemies in order to infiltrate in disguise.&nbsp; 
They can also plant Satchel Charges that can be remotely detonated.<br><br>

Once you've chosen your class, you can choose a weapon from the list beneath the class icons. Some classes have a choice of primary weapons - click the weapon and select from the <a href="#G_WeaponSelector">pop-up list</a>. When you've chosen your weapon, click "OK" to start playing.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="C_PlayingET" id="C_PlayingET"></a><h2>C.	Playing <i>Enemy Territory</i></h2>

Enemy Territory's maps can be played in a variety of ways, but mainly involve constructing, destroying or taking Objectives. The objectives can be studied in the
<a href="#F_CampaignAndLimboMenus">Command Map</a> by hitting (G) 
or the Limbo Menu by hitting (L).<br><br>

To switch to a weapon or tool, press its corresponding number key or cycle to it 
using the next/previous weapon keys.  To use it, press the fire button. Short taps of the Fire button will fire single shots. Hold down the fire button to fire in a long burst or to use a tool for a longer duration. <br><br>

Players will suffer damage from weapons (their own team's, as well as the 
enemy's), from falling from height or drowning. Players can be healed by picking up Health Packs, either from a <a href="#K2_Medic">Medic</a> or from a <a href="#H4_HealthAmmoCabs">Health Cabinet</a>.<br><br>

If a player runs out of health, they die. They can now either be revived by one of their team's Medics, or go back into the Limbo menu and choose another team, class or weapons load-out if they wish. Players in Limbo will respawn 
in the next reinforcement wave at the Spawn Point they've specified in the Command Map.<br><br>

Players can always check on the status of objectives and their teammates' locations by checking their <a href="#F_CampaignAndLimboMenus">Command Map</a> (G). The Command Map will also display any battlefield intelligence gathered by their team's Covert Ops.<br><br>

Players will be alerted to developments on the battlefield by their Command HQ - automated audio messages telling you the state of play and what your next objective is.<br><br>

Players can also talk with each other, either by typing text messages (using the T Universal Say or Y Team Say keys) or actuating the pre-recorded voice messages  in the <a href="#N_Communication">Voice Chat menu</a> (V). <br><br>

Players can also form <a href="#N_FireTeams">FireTeams</a> to coordinate their tactics. Players can talk to member of their own FireTeam by using the U FireTeam Say key.<br><br>

Players will be rewarded for good teamplay with <a href="#M_RanksStatsMedals">Experience Points, extra skills, promotions and medals</a> at the end of the game.<br><br>

Don't step on the little flags in the ground - they're <a href="#J_Weapons">Land Mines</a> and they'll kill you!<br><br>

If you find you can't perform an action or fire a heavy weapon, you probably don't have enough <a href="#G_HUD">Power Bar</a>.<br><br>

Building <a href="#H3_CommandPosts">Command Posts</a> will help your team to fight effectively. While not the primary goal of your team, building and protecting your Command Post while destroying the opposing team's Command Post will give your team a definite advantage.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="D_Movement" id="D_Movement"></a><h2>D.	Movement</h2>

<b>Running, Jumping, Crouching, Leaning, Prone and Crawling</b><br><br>

Players move around the battlefield by controlling the direction they face with their mouse or using their direction keys 
to move in that direction.<br><br>

Holding down sprint (SHIFT) will give you an extra burst of speed. The Stamina Bar shows how much energy for Sprinting or Jumping you have left. Stamina recharges over time. <br><br>

Accuracy is improved if you Crouch or if you go Prone. You can move while Prone by 
crawling. When crawling, you can't shoot, change weapons, or reload. If you are crouched, you can double tap Forward (W) to enter the Prone position 
(This option can be changed in the Options Menu). Leaning (Default Q and E) allows you to peer around corners without unduly exposing yourself. The price of presenting a smaller target is that you cannot fire any weapon while you are leaning.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="E_GameModes" id="E_GameModes"></a><h2>E.	Game Modes</h2>

There are four game modes in Enemy Territory, each with their own particular style of play: Objective Mode, Campaign Mode, Stopwatch Mode, and Last Man Standing. <br><br>

<b>Objective Mode</b><br>
In the Objective game mode teams must accomplish a series of tasks or objectives to win. These objectives can include everything from taking control of specific points on the map to destroying key installations. A team must complete all the 
primary objectives in the time limit to win.<br><br>

<b>Campaign Mode</b><br>
Campaign mode is a form of Objective mode that allows players to compete against each other in a series of related maps. Players can increase their Rank and Skills over the course of the campaign and carry them from map to map. Skills and Rewards persist from map to map for the duration of the Campaign.<br><br>

<b>Stopwatch Mode</b><br>
In Stopwatch mode, teams must accomplish the objectives in the shortest possible time. At the end of a round the teams will switch. The team that was defending will now attack and must now beat their opponents' time from the previous round. Team-switching is not allowed in Stopwatch mode.<br><br>

<b>Last Man Standing (LMS)</b><br>
Last Man Standing is a form of Team Deathmatch where players must completely eliminate the opposing team to win a round. Players have only one life. They can be healed with Health Packs from Medics or Health Cabinets, but will not respawn 
if killed. In LMS there are no skill points, XP does not count towards your 
score and there are no objectives other than to wipe out the opposing team. There are no Last Man Standing Campaigns.<br><br>

<b>Respawning, Reinforcements, and Max Lives</b><br>
In all game modes except Last Man Standing, players will respawn after they die, meaning that they'll come back to life at the team's spawn point with full health and ammo. Players will respawn in reinforcements, or timed waves, that run continuously. The amount of time left until the next reinforcement respawn is shown in the upper left of the screen when a player is killed. The player will only respawn at the next reinforcement period if they've hit the Jump key (Space) before the clock runs out. If the player hasn't hit the jump key, they will stay in limbo and will not respawn. Players can use the reinforcement time to configure their class and weapon in the Limbo Menu. <br><br>

All game modes apart from Last Man Standing can use the Max Lives option. This option makes the player pay a price for using up all of his lives.  The penalty is set to a default three respawn cycles until he can rejoin the fray.<br><br>

<a name="H_StrategicObjectives" id="H_StrategicObjectives"></a><h2>H. Strategic Objectives</h2>

There are several different kinds of objective on the battlefield. Some can be constructed, destroyed, captured or only used by one team.<br><br>

<a name="H1_TeamDoors" id="H1_TeamDoors"></a><h3>H.1 Team Doors</h3>

Team Doors can only be used by players of the appropriate team or an enemy Covert Ops in disguise. The Team Door will remain open for a short time before it closes automatically. You may want to check behind you to make sure no enemy player sneaks in behind you. If you attempt to open an enemy Team Door and you're not a disguised Covert Ops, you'll see this icon.<br><br>

<a name="H2_Constructibles" id="H2_Constructibles"></a><h3>H.2 Constructibles</h3>

Some objectives can be constructed by Engineers. These are identified with team-colored flags (or a gray flag for neutral constructibles, which can be constructed by both teams). Engineers can build them by moving to them until the gray "Build" icon is displayed, and then using their Engineer's tool. A blue bar indicates progress. All constructibles can be destroyed with Dynamite, though some can be destroyed with a Covert Ops Satchel Charge.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="H3_CommandPosts" id="H3_CommandPosts"></a><h3>H.3 Command Posts</h3>

Command Posts are of great tactical importance in Enemy Territory. Command Posts help the entire team by speeding up the recharge rate of the players' Power Bars. This allows, for instance, Field Ops to call in more Air Strikes and distribute more Ammo Packs, Engineers to defuse Dynamite more 
often and Soldiers to fire their mortars more often.  <br><br>

Command Posts are indicated on the Command Map by this icon <img src="../images/allied_command_post.jpg" width="30" height="33" alt="" border="0"> or <img src="../images/axis_command_post.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="" border="0">. 
They can be constructed by Engineers and destroyed by Satchel Charges or Dynamite. They are unaffected by Hand Grenades, Rifle Grenades or Flamethrowers. <br><br>

<a name="H4_HealthAmmoCabs" id="H4_HealthAmmoCabs"></a><h3>H.4 Health and Ammo Cabinets</h3>

<img src="../images/health_and_ammo.jpg" width="30" height="31" alt="" border="0" align="left">

Constructing Command Posts will sometimes also give you an Ammo and Health Cabinet. These contain the same Health Pack and Ammo Packs that are distributed by Medics and Field Ops.<br><br>
 
Un-constructed Command Posts and Health and Ammo Cabinets look like this:<br><br>
 
<div align="center"><img src="../images/unconstructed_commandpost.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" border="0"></div><br><br>

Constructed Command Posts and Health and Ammo Cabinets look like this:<br><br>

<a name="H5_MGNests" id="H5_MGNests"></a><h3>H.5 MG Nests</h3>

Emplaced MG's may be existing emplacements, or constructible MG Nests or MG Towers. Gun Emplacements will often be found at strategic locations on the map, usually near key objectives and controlling them can give a team a distinct defensive advantage. These guns - usually protected inside bunkers or behind sandbag walls - can be used by either team. To use them, move behind the gun to bring up the "Activate" icon, and then press Activate (Enter). To disengage, press "Activate" again. These guns can also be damaged and repaired.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="I_Vehicles" id="I_Vehicles"></a><h2>I.	 Vehicles</h2>

Vehicles play a critical role in accomplishing the objectives in several of Enemy Territory's maps. Vehicles range from Tanks to narrow-gauge railway Tugs to Trucks. Tanks are needed for their massive firepower against critical point targets. Trucks and railway tugs are used to move critical objects.<br><br>

Vehicles are marked on the Command Map with a representative icon. The path they travel is also marked on the Command map.<br><br>

<a name="I1_EscortingVehicles" id="I1_EscortingVehicles"></a><h3>I.1 Escorting Vehicles</h3>

You cannot get into a vehicle and drive it. All that is necessary to make the vehicle move is for a player of the same team to move close to it. The vehicle's non-player driver will then be reassured that he can advance, and the vehicle will move on.<br><br>

<a name="I2_DamagingRepairingVehicles" id="I2_DamagingRepairingVehicles"></a><h3>I.2 Damaging and Repairing Vehicles</h3>

Vehicles cannot be destroyed, only immobilized.<br><br>

One of the goals of the opposing team is to keep the vehicle stationary to prevent the other team from achieving their objective. To accomplish this, the opposing team can use Panzerfausts, Rifle Grenades, Hand Grenades, Dynamite, Land Mines, Satchel Charges and Air and Artillery Strikes to damage the vehicle. When the crosshair is moved over the vehicle, a health meter will show how much damage the tank has taken. <br><br>

When the vehicle has taken damage, it must be repaired. Engineers can repair the vehicle by 
approaching it until the grey "Repair" icon is displayed and then using the Engineer's tool. A blue bar will indicate progress. When the vehicle is repaired and a vehicle-team player is near enough, it will start up and begin moving again.&nbsp; 
A vehicle can only be repaired after it has lost all of its health.<br><br>

Once a vehicle has been used to accomplish the corresponding objective(s), it's no longer needed and can't be moved any further. Even after the vehicle has reached the end of its movement its mounted MG will still be usable, so long as the vehicle is in a state of repair.<br><br>

<a name="I3_VehicleMountedMG" id="I3_VehicleMountedMG"></a><h3>I.3 Vehicle-Mounted MG's</h3>

Tanks sometimes have turret-mounted Machine Guns. To climb into the turret, hit your Activate key (Default F or Enter). You can then fire the Mounted MG by hitting Fire. Turret MGs 
don't run out of ammunition but they do overheat..<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="J_Weapons" id="J_Weapons"></a><h2>J.	Weapons</h2>

<a name="J1_UsingWeapons" id="J1_UsingAWeapon"></a><h3>J.1	Using a Weapon</h3>

To use a weapon, select it with one of the keys listed above and then press Fire (left mouse button or the CTRL key). For machine guns or other repeating-fire weapons, hold down the button or key for sustained fire and tap it for shorter bursts. The crosshair will indicate where you're aiming. <br><br>

<ul>
<li>Short bursts or single shots are more accurate and conserve ammunition more effectively than spraying bullets wildly. The longer the burst, the larger your crosshairs will grow and the less accurate your fire will be.</li>

<li>The Sten MKIIS, Browning .30 MG and MG42 will overheat when used and must cool down after being fired continuously. These weapons will show a small bar near the weapon icon that will turn red when the gun has overheated. Once the weapon cools down it can be fired again.</li>

Most weapons will eventually run out of ammunition and must be reloaded. To reload, press the (R) key. Be careful not to get caught low on Ammo or reloading when attacked - watch your Ammo and reload when necessary before you find yourself in a firefight.<br><br>

Once you've run out of a particular type of Ammo, you will not be able to select a weapon using that Ammo until you've picked up some more. Pick up more Ammo from Field Ops, who can give you Ammo Packs, or by touching Ammo Cabinets found on some maps. You can also get more Ammo for your weapon by running over weapons dropped by other players, provided they use the same type of Ammo.<br><br>

Uniquely for a First Person Shooter, Enemy Territory rewards players with Skills, Rewards and Promotions. Each of Enemy Territory's classes has its own specific skill and abilities, in addition to two general skills that apply to all classes: Light Weapons and Battle Sense. For each class, the use of their primary skill (e.g. First Aid for Medics) results in an increase in Experience Points (XP) and at certain levels these result in a Reward.<br><br> 

Players' Battle Sense, Light Weapons and current class skill level are indicated in the HUD display at the bottom left of the screen. Each skill has four Levels. At each Level the player receives a unique reward.<br><br> 

Improvements in a player's general and class-specific skill level are rewarded periodically with promotion to a superior rank. Ranks in Enemy Territory range from Private to General (and their Axis counterparts). Ranks are displayed on the player's helmet for everyone to see. Ranks are a visible warning to the enemy of a player's current skill level and Experience Points. The best player in each class is awarded a medal at the end of each mission.<br><br>

<h2>O. Servers</h2>

To play Enemy Territory, you must either join a server or start your own. Here's a quick guide to finding servers or creating your own.<br><br> 

<br>

<a name="O1_FindingAServer" id="O1_Servers"></a><h3>0.1 Finding a Server</h3>

When you first start Enemy Territory, click the "Play Online" option to find a server. You'll be taken to the server browser screen. Here's an explanation of the server browser components.<br><br>

<div align="center"><img src="../images/play_online.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" border="0"></div><br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">1.</font> Filters</b><br>
In the "Filters" section, choose what type of servers you want displayed:

<blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">2.</font> Source:</b> displays Local, Internet, or Favorite servers. Click to change.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">3.</font> Gametype:</b> displays only servers running the selected gametype, or "All". Click to change.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">4.</font> Filter checkboxes:</b> filters out the following servers from the list -  empty or full servers, password-protected servers, servers with Friendly Fire off, max lives enabled, Weapons Restrictions, PunkBuster protected, Anti-Lag and Balance Teams enabled.
</blockquote>

<b><font color="#FF0000">5.</font> Server Browser</b><br>
Below the Filters is the server list itself. The list can be sorted according to server name, map name, players, gametype, ping, or filters. 
You can sort by a specific column by clicking on the column header you wish to 
sort by. Clicking a server will select it.&nbsp; <br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">6.</font> Refresh List</b><br>
This will re-query the master server, generating a new, updated list of servers according to the filters set.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">7.</font> Connect to IP</b><br>
This allows the user to enter the IP address of a specific game server.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">8.</font> Server Info</b><br>
This will show you every detail of the Server's settings, rules and configuration.&nbsp; 
It will also show you the current players on the server.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">9.</font> Enable/Disable PunkBuster</b><br>
PunkBuster is a powerful cheat protection technology that prevents dishonest players from gaining an unfair advantage. PunkBuster is NOT enabled by default. Click this button to enable or disable it. Note: many servers will not allow you to join if PunkBuster cheat protection is not enabled.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">10.</font> Back</b><br>
This button brings you back to the main screen.<br><br>

<b><font color="#FF0000">11.</font> Join Server</b><br>
After selecting a server in the server browser, click "Join Server" to begin playing.<br><br>

<div align="center"><img src="../images/host_game.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="" border="0"></div><br><br>

<b>Hosting Dedicated Servers</b> <br><br>

There are two types of servers you can create to run Enemy Territory: Listen servers and Dedicated servers. Listen servers allow you to play the game and host it at the same time, while Dedicated servers only host the game. Dedicated servers use fewer resources than Listen servers, and are therefore more stable to play on. Listen servers work well if you're playing on a LAN.<br><br>

To create a server, click on "Host Game" at the main menu. The "Host Game" screen contains a number of options that allow you to configure the server. <br><br>

<b>Settings</b><br>
This area allows you to configure the server properties - game type, server name, PunkBuster protection, and more.<br><br>

<b>Gametype</b><br>
As you change the game type, a list of available maps will appear. Click a map to select it. In Campaign mode, you can select a campaign, which consists of the three maps shown in the right-hand window.<br><br>

<b>Details</b><br>
This window contains a description of the map and its objectives.<br><br>

<b>Advanced</b><br>
Clicking this button will take you to a screen that allows you to set more advanced options, such as the Message of the Day, remote console passwords, and more.<br><br>

<b>Start Server</b><br>
Once you've configured the server, click this button to start it.<br><br>
