<p>PunkBuster</p>
</font>
</b><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p>It is highly recommended that you always host games with PunkBuster on... and
only join servers with PunkBuster on.&nbsp; This is an excellent tool for
preventing cheating.</p>
<p>There are a few times when we suggest you not host PunkBuster games.&nbsp;
You should not host a game on PunkBuster if you are running a Listen server
(playing on the same machine that is hosting).&nbsp; You should not host a game
on PunkBuster if you are running a dedicated on a small LAN that is not
connected to the Internet.&nbsp; Doing so may cause minor performance issues and
doesn't do much good.</p>
<p>If you change a PunkBuster cvar, there are no commands to restore your
settings to default.</p>
<p>If you host a Listen server, you will be unable to chat through the web tool.</p>
<p><font size="2">PunkBuster should auto-update when new versions are
available.&nbsp; In the event that this does not happen or the update fails, the
user can manually update PunkBuster.&nbsp; Once the game has been launched, type
the following commands into the console (`)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \pb_cl_enable (please check
the version number)</font><br>
<font size="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \pb_sv_enable (please check the
version number)</font><br>
<font size="2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \pb_sv_update (this will send a
request to the master server for the update. This process may take several
minute depending on&nbsp;&nbsp; computer and connection speed.)<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the download
process is done the user will see a message stating &quot;PunkBuster Server:
PunkBuster Server (v1.xxx I axxxx c1.xxxx Enabled)&quot;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Cvar issues</p>
</b>
<p>Most options that you would consider wanting to use can be set from somewhere
in the UI (user interface) - from the options or controls menu, or in one of the
in-game menus. Further, chances are that if an option isn't set in the UI
somewhere, it's not relevant to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. You should,
therefore, use the UI options instead of console commands to set options wherever
possible. Console commands may produce unexpected results and should generally
be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following commands are some of the common ones that expert players may be
familiar with from other games - but do NOT work in Wolfenstein: Enemy
Territory:</p>
<p><font size="2">\g_synchronousclients (removed)</font><br>
<font size="2">\r_stencilbits (crashes game)</font><br>
<font size="2">\r_texturebits (defaults to 0 after crash, visual artifacts)</font><br>
<font size="2">\sv_reconnectlimit (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\r_smp (set to 1 is not supported)</font><br>
<font size="2">\g_drawammowarning (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\r_debugsort (crashes PC)</font><br>
<font size="2">\r_showimages (not supported)</font></p>
<p>The following commands are some of the
common PunkBuster commands that are different in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
(as the writing of this document):&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2">\rcon pb_sv_cvarval (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\rcon pb_sv_cvaruser&nbsp; (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\rcon pb_sv_cvarsrch (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\rcon pb_sv_cvarchanged (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\pb_sv_cvardel (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\pb_cvarVal&nbsp; (returns duplicate entries)</font><br>
<font size="2">\pb_sv_cvarempty (not functional)</font><br>
<font size="2">\pb_sv_bindsrch (not functional)</font></p>
</font></font><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Server Issues</b></p>
<p>- Creating / joining Fireteams</p>
<p>The maximum number of players in a Fireteam is 6.&nbsp; After a fireteam is
at 6, no one else will be allowed to join until someone leaves or is kicked out
of the group.</p>
<p>- Saving Server Options</p>
<p>Please be aware that no create server options are saved until you actually
hit &quot;Accept&quot; and start a server. If you make changes to the server
settings and then don't start the server, you'll lose your changes. Saving on
the Advanced Server Settings screen will not be affected by changes you make on
this screen as they are saved separately.</p>
<p>- Max Players + Hunkmegs</p>
<p>The maximum number of players for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is 32 total and 16
for each side; the server host can set this to a lower number from the
Multiplayer/Create Server menu. It is highly recommended that these numbers are
not exceeded. In games that include players using dial-up connections, no more
than 8 players are recommended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to host more than 32 players on the server (not recommended), you
will need to increase the memory allocated to Wolfenstein: Enemy
Territory.&nbsp; If you don't, the game will likely fail to start with a &quot;Hunkmegs&quot;
error.&nbsp; To increase the memory, open the console and type &quot;\com_hunkmegs
128&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Repeated Map Restarts</p>
<p>Repeatedly restarting the server can cause a crash.&nbsp; It is not 
recommended that you do this more than a few times in a row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Graphics Issues</b></p>
<p>- 32-bit vs. 16-bit Color Depth</p>
<p>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory defaults to your desktop color depth. We 
strongly recommend that you play it in 32-bit color depth. You may change this
setting to 16-bit, but it is not officially supported. If you decide to make
this change, you may notice graphics problems and artifacts on your screen.
Also, during preliminary testing, there was not much of a performance increase
by making this switch. Please do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>- Windowed Mode</p>
<p>Playing Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory in a window will cause the top portion 
of the screen to be cut off.&nbsp; This is due to the Windows title bar being 
drawn on top of the game window.</p>
<p>- Menu Sliders</p>
<p>None of the slider menus update in real time.&nbsp; For example, you will not
see changes in brightness or sound when changing a slider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ingame Issues</b></p>
<p>- Dual Monitor Support</p>
<p>Dual monitors are not supported by Enemy Territory and may cause the game to 
function improperly.</p>
<p>- Prone Players and Airstrikes</p>
<p>Brave players can go prone on Airstrike markers, block the visual cue, and cause them to be
aborted if done early enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Inactivity</p>
<p>If the player inactivity is set on a server it still counts down even if a 
player is only using his mouse.&nbsp; The mouse input is not counted towards 
activity.</p>
<p>- Multiple Instances</p>
<p>Running multiple instances of the game on the same system can cause graphics 
problems.&nbsp; This is not recommended.</p>
<p>- Reviving Underwater<br>
<br>
Players awaiting revival cannot be revived while underwater.</p>
<p>- Uninstalling the Game</p>
<p>If the uninstaller is cancelled during the uninstallation process, the game 
will not be removable via the uninstaller.&nbsp; You will have to 
manually uninstall the game.</p>
<p>- Shell Default Button</p>
<p>Pressing the default button in the shell will not reset the mouse sensitivity 
setting.</p>
<p>- Foreign Characters</p>
<p>Some foreign characters are not supported and will not be displayed properly 
in the game.&nbsp; Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory has been tested with US versions
of the operating systems.&nbsp; Compatibility may not be 100% with other
versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="2">- Performance Boosters</font></b></p>
<p>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory allows you to customize your settings so that
you can improve the visuals or decrease them.&nbsp; Some of them have a greater
impact on performance <font size="2">than others.&nbsp; Below are some settings
that will improve your performance, but at the expense of the visuals:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the system options to 'Fastest'<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \com_maxfps (set to a high number i.e 400)<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \cg_atmosphericeffects 0<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \cg_wolfparticles 0<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r_fastsky 1<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r_picmip 3<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \cg_drawgun 0</font></p>
