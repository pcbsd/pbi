Multiple<br>matches at a time score more points, and dump more rocks on the opponent (a<br>quintuple-match will dump around 20 rocks on the opponent, all at once).<br><br> We ported it overnight to Linux, so we could play whenever we felt like. The<br>AI's evolved more slowly, over the course of a week or so. I welcome sugges-<br>tions on how to make the AI's more difficult during the game currently, they<br>are rather easy to beat on easy level, but more difficult on hard.
